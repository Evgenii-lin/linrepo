To install Nginx, Postgress database, let's create a file called web_services.yml and write in this file:

---

 - hosts: all
   become:true
   tasks:
 
 - name: update repository
   apt:
       update_cache: yes

 - name: nginx install
   apt:
       name:nginx
       state:latest
  
 - name: psdb install
   apt:
       name:postgress
       state:latest

 - name: Install Grafana Agent Flow
   tasks:
    - name: Install Grafana Agent Flow
      ansible.builtin.include_role:
        name: grafana.grafana.grafana_agent

To launch the playbook we'll use the command:

ansible-playbook --ask-become-pass web_services.yml
